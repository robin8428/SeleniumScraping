BSF 3.1
-------

The BSF 3.1 binary release contains 3 jars:

bsf-api-3.1.jar
- this contains all the javax.script classes as defined in the
  JSR-223 specification. This jar may be used as an application 
  dependency when the application is using javax.script classes
  in a version of Java prior to 1.6 (which includes the classes)

bsf-utils-3.1.jar
- this contains various BSF specific utilities which aid using
  script languages from Java applications. 

bsf-all-3.1.jar
- this contains both the other BSF jars merged into a single jar for 
  ease of use. If you're not sure which jar to use then use this one.

BSF 3.1 is compatible with Java 1.4.2 and above. Specific script 
languages may have further requirements on the Java version.  

IMPORTANT
=========
Note that BSF 3.1 does not contain bsf-engines.jar, which was a repackaging
of the JSR-223 factories from https://scripting.dev.java.net/.

This is because:
- the jar contained all the engine factories as a single bundle. It was not
  possible to select individual factories, and this could lead to clashes with
  other factories on the classpath.
- the jar did not contain any implementations, so it was still necessary to download
  the engine.
Many engines contain their own factories now; for those that don't the factory can
still be downloaded from https://scripting.dev.java.net/.
